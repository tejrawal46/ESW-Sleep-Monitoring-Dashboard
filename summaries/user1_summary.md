## Frequency Analysis Summary

### ECG - Baseline
Dominant Frequency: 0.0134 Hz
Interpretation: Normal heart rhythm variability typical of relaxed sleep state

### EMG - Baseline
Dominant Frequency: 0.0024 Hz
Interpretation: Low muscle activity frequency suggests deep relaxation and reduced muscle tone typical of deep sleep

### MPU - Baseline
Dominant Frequency: 0.0140 Hz
Interpretation: Low movement frequency typical of normal sleep with occasional position adjustments

### ECG - Sleep Session 1
Dominant Frequency: 0.0001 Hz
Interpretation: Very stable heart rhythm with minimal frequency variation

### EMG - Sleep Session 1
Dominant Frequency: 0.0001 Hz
Interpretation: Low muscle activity frequency suggests deep relaxation and reduced muscle tone typical of deep sleep

### MPU - Sleep Session 1
Dominant Frequency: 0.0001 Hz
Interpretation: Minimal movement frequency indicating very still sleep with rare position changes

### ECG - Sleep Session 2
Dominant Frequency: 0.0001 Hz
